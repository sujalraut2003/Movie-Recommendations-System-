# Movie-Recommendations-System-
A movie recommendation system built using Flask and machine learning techniques. The app suggests personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and behavior. It leverages a pre-trained model and offers a simple interface for users to interact with, providing tailored movie suggestions.

To run and upload your movie recommendation system project to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Set Up Your Project Locally
Ensure you have all the necessary files for your movie recommender system (e.g., Python scripts, movie_dict.pkl, any model files, etc.).
Organize your project into a directory structure, for example:
perl
Copy code
movie-recommendation-system/
├── app.py                # Flask app (or your main Python script)
├── movie_dict.pkl        # Your pre-trained model or data
├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies for the project
├── templates/            # HTML templates for Flask (if applicable)
├── static/               # Static files like CSS, JavaScript, images (if applicable)
└── README.md             # Documentation about your project
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
If you haven't already, create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment (use python3 if python isn't the default):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
If you have a requirements.txt file, install all the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt yet, create it by running:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Dependencies you might need:

Flask
pandas
scikit-learn (if you're using machine learning for recommendations)
numpy
etc. (depending on your project)
4. Run the Flask Application (if applicable)
If your project involves a Flask app (app.py), start the server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will run the local server, and you can access it at http://127.0.0.1:5000 (default Flask port).

5. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
In the new repository, click the Create Repository button.
6. Initialize Git in Your Project Folder
Inside your project directory, initialize a Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
Add all files to the staging area:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the files:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
7. Push Your Project to GitHub
Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository (replace USERNAME and REPO_NAME with your GitHub username and repo name):
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
Push the files to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
8. Ensure Your movie_dict.pkl and Large Files Are Managed Properly
If your movie_dict.pkl or other large files are too big to upload directly, use Git LFS (Large File Storage):

Install Git LFS:
bash
Copy code
git lfs install
Track your .pkl file with Git LFS:
bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.pkl"
git add .gitattributes
git add movie_dict.pkl
git commit -m "Add large model file"
git push
9. Add a README.md File
In your README.md, describe:

The project purpose.
How to run it.
Any dependencies.
Example usage.
Example README.md:

markdown
Copy code
# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system built using Flask and machine learning.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
10. Push Your Final Changes
Once you've updated the README and added any final changes, push them:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add README and final changes"
git push
